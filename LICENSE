Copyright (c) 2025 Brian Lee Baros
SOFTDEV0 LLC. and Brian Lee Baros (“Licensor”)

This license is intended to keep SarahMemory free and user-owned for individuals and
non-corporate use, while requiring a paid commercial license for corporate/commercial use.

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to the terms below.

1) DEFINITIONS
--------------
“Software” means the SarahMemory Project source code, binaries, documentation, and
associated files in this repository (including all updates, patches, mods, and build artifacts).

“Non-Commercial Use” means use by an individual person, non-profit, hobbyist, researcher,
or community group where the Software is not used primarily to generate commercial revenue
and is not used by or on behalf of a commercial entity.

“Corporate / Commercial Use” means use by, for, or on behalf of:
- any corporation, company, LLC, partnership, or other commercial entity; OR
- any government agency using the Software for commercial procurement/contracted operations; OR
- any use that is part of a paid product, paid service, or revenue-generating business process,
  including internal business operations, production systems, customer support systems, or
  commercial deployments.

“Corporate License” means a paid license agreement issued by the Licensor (including a time-
limited subscription license) that permits Corporate / Commercial Use and may grant access to
corporate update channels, enterprise patches, or proprietary add-ons.

2) GRANT OF RIGHTS (NON-COMMERCIAL USE)
--------------------------------------
Subject to the restrictions in this license, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license to:
- use the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
- copy and redistribute the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
- modify the Software and distribute your modifications for Non-Commercial Use.

3) CORPORATE / COMMERCIAL USE REQUIRES A PAID LICENSE
-----------------------------------------------------
Corporate / Commercial Use is NOT permitted under this Community License.

If you are a corporation or otherwise engaging in Corporate / Commercial Use, you must obtain
a Corporate License from the Licensor before using, copying, modifying, distributing, or deploying
the Software for that purpose.

5) UPDATES, PATCHES, AND CORPORATE UPDATE CHANNELS
--------------------------------------------------
The Licensor may provide updates via public community channels (e.g., GitHub) and may also
provide separate corporate update channels (e.g., authenticated patch feeds). Access to corporate
update channels may require a valid Corporate License.

The Software may include optional mechanisms to verify corporate licenses locally (including
offline verification) for the purpose of enabling corporate update feeds. Such mechanisms are
intended to control access to corporate updates, not to lock or restrict the base Software for
Non-Commercial Use.
