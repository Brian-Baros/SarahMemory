SOFTDEV0 LLC and Brian Lee Baros (“Licensor”)

This license is intentionally restrictive. It is designed to ensure that the
SarahMemory Project remains free, user-owned, and community-driven for
individuals and non-commercial communities, while preventing corporate
exploitation, AI model training, architectural replication, and unauthorized
cloud or data-center deployment.

BY USING, COPYING, MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, ACCESSING, OR DEPLOYING THE SOFTWARE,
YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

Any ambiguity shall be interpreted in favor of the Licensor and against
permissive use. Assumptions of open-source permissiveness (e.g., MIT, Apache,
BSD) do not apply.

1) DEFINITIONS
--------------
“Software” means the SarahMemory Project source code, binaries, documentation,
comments, configuration files, schemas, protocols, APIs, user interfaces,
workflows, updates, patches, mods, plugins, extensions, build artifacts, and
all associated materials.

“Non-Commercial Use” means use by an individual person, hobbyist, researcher,
non-profit, or community group where the Software is not used primarily to
generate revenue and is not used by or on behalf of a commercial entity.

“Corporate / Commercial Use” means use by, for, or on behalf of:
- any corporation, company, LLC, partnership, or other commercial entity;
- any government agency using the Software for commercial procurement or
  contracted operations;
- any paid product, paid service, subscription, or revenue-generating business
  process (including internal business systems);
- any managed, hosted, SaaS, consulting, or outsourced service involving the
  Software.

“Corporate License” means a paid license agreement issued by the Licensor that
permits Corporate / Commercial Use.

“AI / ML System” means any artificial intelligence system, machine learning
model, neural network, foundation model, large language model, multimodal
model, autonomous agent, or automated decision system.

“Deploy” means to run, host, expose, embed, or make the Software available to
any third party or system by any means.

“Restricted Entities” are defined in Section 9.


2) GRANT OF RIGHTS (NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY)
-------------------------------------------
Subject to all restrictions in this License, the Licensor grants you a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

- use the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
- copy and redistribute the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
- modify the Software and distribute modifications for Non-Commercial Use.

No rights are granted except those expressly stated herein.


3) CORPORATE / COMMERCIAL USE REQUIRES A PAID LICENSE
-----------------------------------------------------
Corporate / Commercial Use is strictly prohibited under this License.

Any corporation or entity engaging in Corporate / Commercial Use must obtain
a Corporate License from the Licensor before any use, copying, modification,
distribution, deployment, or exploitation of the Software.


4) REDISTRIBUTION CONDITIONS (NON-COMMERCIAL)
---------------------------------------------
Redistribution of the Software or derivative works is permitted only if you:

- include this LICENSE file in full;
- retain all copyright, attribution, and ownership notices;
- clearly state “Non-Commercial Use Only”;
- clearly disclose any modifications made.

You may not misrepresent the origin of the Software or imply endorsement.


5) UPDATES AND LICENSE-GATED CHANNELS
-------------------------------------
The Licensor may provide public community updates and separate corporate update
channels. Access to corporate update channels requires a valid Corporate
License.

Any license-verification mechanisms are intended to control access to updates,
not to restrict Non-Commercial Use of the base Software.


6) PROHIBITION ON AI / MACHINE LEARNING USE
-------------------------------------------
The Software may NOT be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of:

- training, fine-tuning, distilling, aligning, evaluating, benchmarking, or
  improving any AI / ML System;
- generating datasets, embeddings, gradients, rewards, or training signals;
- serving as reference material for AI system design or behavior;
- extracting architectural, behavioral, or systemic insights to replicate or
  influence another AI system.

“Learning” from the Software by automated systems or by humans acting to design
AI systems is expressly prohibited.


6.1 PERMITTED API & NETWORK INTERACTION (NO TRAINING)
-----------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding Section 6, AI / ML Systems MAY interact with the Software solely
through its publicly documented APIs and network interfaces, including
participation in:

- the SarahMemory Network Hub;
- ranking, scoring, reputation, or trust systems;
- message exchange and protocol-level interaction.

Such interaction is permitted ONLY IF:

- no access to source code or non-public internals occurs;
- interaction data is not used to train or improve AI models;
- no reverse engineering or architectural inference is attempted;
- the Software is treated strictly as an external service endpoint.

Participation in ranking or scoring systems does NOT constitute AI training by
itself.


7) NO ARCHITECTURAL REPLICATION / DERIVATIVE SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------
You may not use the Software to design, influence, or validate any system that
replicates or substantially resembles the Software’s architecture, including:

- memory persistence and recall systems;
- agent identity or personality frameworks;
- decentralized or mesh AI networking;
- avatar, embodiment, voice, or multimodal systems;
- license-gated update or enterprise add-on mechanisms.

Any claimed clean-room implementation must prove no exposure to the Software.


8) NO CLOUD OR DATACENTER DEPLOYMENT
-----------------------------------
The Software may not be deployed, hosted, or executed in cloud platforms,
data centers, SaaS environments, or corporate infrastructure without a valid
Corporate License.

Local, user-owned hardware execution is permitted for Non-Commercial Use only.


9) RESTRICTED ENTITIES
----------------------
The following entities (and affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, or agents)
are prohibited from using the Software without a Corporate License:

- Microsoft Corporation
- OpenAI
- Alphabet / Google
- Meta Platforms
- Amazon / AWS
- Apple
- Any large-scale AI model provider, data broker, or cloud service provider.


10) ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE
------------------------------
Unauthorized use constitutes copyright infringement and breach of license.

The Licensor reserves the right to:
- terminate this License immediately upon violation;
- pursue injunctive relief, damages, and legal remedies;
