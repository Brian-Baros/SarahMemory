Launching the Application & Developer Operational Instructions

Initial Launch
---------------
Before running SarahMemory for regular use, the system must generate its internal directory structure and datasets.

Run the following:
python SarahMemoryMain.py

On the first execution, the program will initialize required folders and system paths.
It will then exit automatically once the structure is created.


Dataset Initialization
-----------------------
Next, generate the default SarahMemory databases:

python SarahMemoryDBCreate.py

This script creates approximately 10 core databases and populates them with baseline values.
Once complete, launch the program again:

python SarahMemoryMain.py


Optional Performance Enhancements & Personalization Tools
----------------------------------------------------------
The following components are optional. They are not required for normal operation but can improve performance and personalization.


Optional: Install Additional Language Models / Object Models
------------------------------------------------------------
Run the model setup utility:

python SarahMemoryLLM.py

This tool allows you to:
- Install 3rd-party language models
- Install additional sentence-transformers
- Install object-detection and vision models

Model usage preferences can be configured in:
SarahMemoryGlobals.py


Advanced Personalization (Optional)
-----------------------------------
These tools enable deeper system integration and dataset expansion. Intended for advanced users.


Step 1 — System Indexing
Run:
python SarahMemorySystemIndexer.py

This tool indexes selected parts of your system, including:
- Application paths
- System data
- Windows Registry entries
- Custom folders and documents

Indexing assists SarahMemory’s AI-Agent with automation and voice-triggered commands.


Step 2 — System Learning
Run:
python SarahMemoryLearn.py

This script processes the indexed dataset and integrates selected information into the databases
created earlier via SarahMemoryDBCreate.py.


Advanced Customization (Expert Users)
--------------------------------------
As of version 7.7.5, the configuration menu inside SarahMemoryGUI.py is not finalized.

You may run it:
python SarahMemoryGUI.py

However, settings cannot yet be reliably saved from the GUI.

Advanced configuration must be performed manually in:
SarahMemoryGlobals.py
