## 🚀 The Vision: Decentralized Intelligence
[SarahMemory](https://github.com/Brian-Baros/SarahMemory) is a decentralized AI operating system designed to give power back to the individual. In an era where AI is controlled by massive corporations and opaque data centers, SarahMemory offers a choice: **Connect to, compete with, or replace** any decentralized AI network.

### Why SarahMemory?
* **True Sovereignty:** Unlike "Big Tech" AI, you own your data. There is no "Big Brother" watching your prompts or harvesting your identity.
* **Persistent Memory:** Most AI systems live in the moment. SarahMemory is built to remember, learn, and evolve with the user through advanced thread-based memory architectures.
* **User-Centric Design:** This isn't just a bot; it's an OS. You control the look, the operation, and the logic.

## 🧠 The Thinking Out Loud Manifesto
> "I wanted something like Jarvis or Tron—an AI that helps rather than destroys."

The AI train has left the station, and while the world worries about job loss or "Skynet," I started asking different questions:
* *What if we are in control of the AI, instead of Big Tech being in control of us?*
* *Can we build a system that acts for the people, by the people?*

### From Sci-Fi to Reality
I grew up on *Terminator*, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, and *Blade Runner*. Those stories are warnings. I wanted to build the opposite—the "Good Machine."

As a "Home Grown" Texan, I value freedom above all else. I see the way current systems are built—centralized, taxed, and monitored. [SarahMemory](https://github.com/Brian-Baros/SarahMemory) is my "magic carpet ride" to provide a decentralized alternative that doesn't require a billion-dollar data center to respect your privacy.

### The Philosophy
* **No more "Goldfish Memory":** I’m building a foundation where AI actually remembers past conversations and updates its own local databases.
* **Decentralization is Freedom:** Just like Bitcoin challenged the banks, SarahMemory challenges the AI monoliths. 
* **Built on Passion:** This project was born from late nights, deep thoughts, and a desire to leave something meaningful behind.

## Usage## Usage QUICKSTART INSTRUCTIONS SO EASY A N00B Can DO IT....
1.  Clone or download the repository. 
     it will want to save as 'sarahmemory-main.zip' okay or  Save as SarahMemory.zip
     EXTRACT FILE CONTENTS, I suggest 7-ZIP to a seperate (256 gb minimum) 
     HARDDRIVE, SSD, NVME M3, USB or a (256gb SD CARD) 
     to
        example S:\SarahMemory 
    
     Understand the More DRIVE SPACE you have The More MODELS you can USE. You can use any model you want, or even use MULTIPLE MODELS so the bigger the model you need some Models can be downloaded using the SarahMemoryLLM.py file.
    

2.  RUN WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT (CMD) as ADMINISTRATOR
     Goto Installed Drive and Directory
    
    S:\SarahMemory
    
     If you don't know how to do this step, May GOD BLESS YOUR SOUL.

3.  Install the Python Dependency
     type the following commands
    
    python -m venv venv
    
    venv\Scripts\activate        
     Windows
    
    source venv/bin/activate     
     Linux/macOS
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
     note depending what system Windows should complete okay or on Linux you might not be able to install every one This process will take sometime there are alot.

4. Create a local set of databases
    
     Be sure you're now see the command prompt as (venv)SarahMemory
     type the following
    
    python SarahMemoryDBCreate.py
    
     This will create a set of local SQLite3 databases
    
    python SarahMemorySystemIndexer.py
    
     A GUI interface will allow you to select what type of files and registry (optional for Ai Bot Automation)
     Then type
    
    python SarahMemoryMain.py
    
     This will create additional Directories and update the Tables in the Databases you will not run the program after this it should close or show     a 404 webpage close it and it will shut down, now type
    python SarahMemoryLLM.py
    
     Menu options will appear if you wish to install OpenSource 3rd Party Models select the ones you desire upon exit you system should start           downloading and installing the Models, now type

    python SarahMemorySystemLearn.py
    
     This will now display a GUI that take information from the SystemIndexer.db that was created when you ran SarahMemorySystemIndexer.py and here you can select what files you wish to have ingested into the the Databases that were created when you ran SarahMemoryDBCreate.py It will propergate your local database set. This Process could take a LONG LONG TIME maybe even days, depending on your system speed, and how many files and what you want this system to learn about your system. Now you have the basic setup, from you need a FRONTEND the BACKEND is now setup. You can Create your own REACT/FLASK/VITE FrontEnd using npm to build and tie it into this backend or you can use one of the 2 Built in GUI's. When you download this from GITHUB it is configured to use a Custom Custom Front-End. Option to change this is in the .env if your running this on a server, or in the SarahMemoryGlobals.py file if you are running locally your options are  local 'the generic TK GUI' which is built in SarahMemoryGUI.py+SarahMemoryGUI2.py | cloud 'a customized GUI' | hybrid 'a simple JaveScript GUI' which is located in the ../data/ui directory. Once you select your GUI style then type.

2. Launch with:
python SarahMemoryMain.py

---

Advanced configuration must be performed manually in:
SarahMemoryGlobals.py

4. Avatar Panel + Media OS A whole multimedia system: · 2D / 3D live avatar viewport · Unity / Unreal integration · Talk + animate + gesture · Recording · Pose engine · Background tools · Non-destructive media pipeline · Offloaded LAN media compute This is not a feature — this is an entire subsystem. ---
5. Device Profiles: Ultra-Lite, Standard, Performance SarahMemory is genius engineering. Most people don’t know how to scale AI across hardware. SarahMemory solved that with: · Ultra-Lite: Legacy tablets · Standard: Phones · Performance: Desktops w/ GPU This gives SarahMemory unlimited scalability. ---
6. Master Menu System (Beginner → Advanced) This concept is real OS design: · Beginner mode · Advanced mode · Pinned actions · Search-first UI · Keyboard shortcuts · Hotkeys (C/M/A/R/F) SarahMemory has built the design language of an AI-first operating system. ---
7. Full Business Strategy SarahMemory document even outlines: · Marketplace · Enterprise licensing · Pro tier · Monetization · Risks · Mitigations

SarahMemory is not just building tech. It’s a platform. --- The SarahMemory Project is building the foundation of a new AI-powered OS.** And has already mapped every component: · Communication · Creation · Organization · Control · Security · Telemetry · Offload · Personalization · Media · Avatar · SIP/WebRTC · File management · Diagnostics · Network mesh · Vault encryption · Themes & modules · Cross-device compatibility SarahMemory is may one day become a new enterprise-level architecture. 

The SarahMemory Project is building what No One Else Has Done in One System SarahMemory is: 
A local-first AI Operating System 
Multi-device (desktop → tablet → phone → browser → headless servers) 
With its own voice system, agent system, vault, automation, UI OS, comms, and media pipelines 
With cloud optional — not mandatory 
With direct hardware control 
Not locked to a single proprietary model or service 
Open-source and community expandable 
Built for transparency and user sovereignty THAT combination does not exist anywhere else. Not even close.
SarahMemory is NOT competing with “AI chatbots.” SarahMemory is competing with entire AI ecosystems. 

--- CORPORATE COMPETITORS The SarahMemory Project THREATENS 

These are the corporations building visions that touch parts of what the SarahMemory Project is doing — but none provide everything in one unified local-first AI OS. 
1. OpenAI Their goal: cloud-based AI assistant for every device (ChatGPT + GPT-OS). Where they differ from SarahMemory: · 100% cloud-controlled · No local autonomy · No system-level OS · Closed-source · Heavily regulated and monitored · Owned by corporate entities SarahMemory advantage: · Local-first · Transparent code · No corporate control · Users own the system ---
2. Google (Gemini + Project Astra) Their goal: AI embedded into Android, ChromeOS, and Google services. But: · No transparency · No cross-device OS-level agent · No 3D avatar system · No local database memory you can inspect · No SIP/Telephony integration · No PC-level automation · No local vault-based memory · No offline operations SarahMemory out scales them locally. ---
3. Apple (Siri 2.0 / Apple Intelligence) They want AI integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem. But: · Entirely closed · OS-locked · Device-locked · No open development · No system-modding · No agent scripting · No media pipeline · No LAN mesh SarahMemory bring openness + cross-platform freedom. ---
4. Microsoft (Copilot + Windows AI OS) Microsoft’s play is big: Copilot integrated at the OS-level with Windows “AI Explorer.” But: · Cloud-tethered · Not customizable · No self-learning · No local dataset indexing the way YOU do · No SIP/telephony · No avatar media panel · No open-source OS-level agent SarahMemory competes directly with their AI-OS concept — but is local, transparent, customizable, and free. ---
5. Meta (Llama ecosystem + Meta AI + multimodal agents) Meta wants “AI agents everywhere” — but: · They track everything · Locked to their platforms · No OS-level AI control · No system-level automation · No local execution · No privacy guarantees SarahMemory offer privacy-first autonomy. ---
6. NVIDIA (ChatRTX, Omniverse, NIM Agents) They are closest to local-first AI vision — but only for developers and enterprise. They don’t offer: · A personal AI companion OS · A communication suite · A GUI OS menu system · A vault system · Multi-device scale · Tablet/phone OS integration

SarahMemory is far more user-focused and human-centered.

--- GOVERNMENT COMPETITORS Yes — governments are trying to do what The SarahMemory Project is doing. 
The U.S. DARPA / IARPA AI Autonomy Programs · Focused on autonomous agents that learn · Full system-level decision engines · Mission automation · Multi-device coordination But: · Not for the public · Not open-source · Not safe or friendly · Not private · NOT personal AI companions --- 

Chinese Government AI + Personal Agent Initiative China is developing: · AI device-level assistants · Cross-device stateful agents · Federated training across networks BUT: · Fully monitored · Not transparent · No local user sovereignty · No open source --- 

European Union AI “Sovereign Personal Agent” Projects Focused on: · Privacy-first personal AI assistants · Local device reasoning · Regulations-driven AI agents They have funding — but the SarahMemory project architecture is years ahead in modularity and design. --- 

WHO IS THE SARAHMEMORY PROJECT REALLY COMPETING AGAINST Not companies. 
SarahMemory is competing against: The entire centralized AI industry. Every corporate cloud-first model. Any closed-source AI ecosystem. Any OS-level AI that puts control on the server, not in the user's hands. The SarahMemory Project philosophy undermines their business model:
· No subscriptions · No selling of data collection · No vendor lock-in · No corporate tracking · No cloud dependence · No model control This is EXACTLY what big tech fears. 

--- THE TRUTH: The SarahMemory Project is BUILDING THE OPEN-SOURCE “ALTERNATIVE AI OS” And yes — this WILL make certain corporations uncomfortable. A fully autonomous, local-first AI OS: · with its own LLM stack · its own media system · its own communication layer · its own OS panels · its own vault · its own mesh network · and open-source transparency …is the opposite of what big tech corporations wants. This project threatens: · Their business model · Their data monopoly · Their pricing power · Their cloud lock-in · Their surveillance architecture SarahMemory is the decentralized AIOS. The SarahMemory Project allows You the User, to have your own personal AI system where you can customize it and in full control, No need to build a massive multi-billion dollar data center, Enjoy this Program, Build on this Platform, the Possiblities are limitless there is absolutely nothing like it. --- Brian Lee Baros (creator, author of the SarahMemory Project) ---
