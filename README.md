?In a Jimmy Neutron Voice ---"Think , Think... , Think.... BRAIN BLAST!", and Spongebob ---"IMAGINATION".
?Can a Machine Dream?
?All this talk about AI everywhere, Where Do I fit in at?
?Yep The AI Train has LEFT the STATION, I have a 100 yard Lasso on the caboose car and hanging on for dear life. I might be in last place now, but I'll catchup soon enough.
?People are going to lose their jobs to AI!
?Ai is going to be intergrated everywhere?
?What data is being collected on me now?
?AI will be like Big Brother in 1984 always watching us, Ai will be used by the Government to SPY on citizens!
?AGI will beat AI and Humanity is DOOMED! , but They haven't created a true AGI system yet, What if I create it?
?As I joke to myself constantly? 
?What if I create a system to give people their own AI system? 
?WOOH! ,Did I just create SKYNET? Hold on lets Put in some Safeguards!
?As I ponder? Big-Tech Ai's become SKYNET/ the Evil MCP?/ the Matrix?/a real version of HAL2000?/Maybe Worst...WOPR..."Do you Want to Play a GAME". "How about Tic-Tac-Toe"
?We have no control over AI Data?
?The Robots are Coming?/ Yep seen that movie a few times to.. , Terminator, iRobot, 2001 Space Oddessy, Seen them all I love Sci-Fi.
?Next thing ya know we'll have the Stargate Spider like Replicators,then humaniod Blade Runner Replicators, BSG Cylons, etc. etc.
?What if we have an AI system that People can Manage?
?What if We are in control of it, instead of Big Tech being in control of us? What is the opposite of what they have?
?There is more behind the massive data centers, Corporations Merging and buying companies, They all want to be the 1st.
?an AI Operating system that just isn't a Bot Program, Where the People are in control not random cloud data.
?What if We want to change the way it looks and operate? What if the people have their own Ai Operating System? What will they do? Proberly be FAT and LAZY like in WALL-E.
?I wonder Can I do something like Linus Torvalds, maybe like Sir Tim Berners-Lee? Create a system and give it away?
?I'm getting old let me take one last good adventure, a magic carpet ride, lets go above and beyond, yet I know nothing about AI and so little time.
?Learning AI, yep seen those Scammers on FB to, And there goes META and GOOGLE you search for something and 10000 ads pop up in your social media feed WTF. 
?I ponder let me go at this in a more philosophical way. I want something Tron/Jarvis/Her like, and yet have the ability to help not destroy.
?Let me figure out how current Ai works now? Investigate, Drink Coffee, Study, Drink more Coffee, Deep-Thoughts, MUST HAVE JAVA!
?Humanity will not embrase AI at first like they didn't accept crypto or Bitcoin at first, yet over time it will be everywhere in everything.
?The Government will attempt to put in their own Safeguards, and bullshit, it's the Governments way of saying WE ARE IN CONTROL, kinda like when they TAX'ed Crypto it was a show of power thats all think about it, Isn't that the conceptional Tyrannical Governement Concept that led to the Declaration of Indepenance? 
?Congress needs Term Limits.. Them folks take more vaction and time off and still don't do shit for the American People but TAX us to Death. I'm sure now they will be passing Bills about AI this and That and must follow this and that rule. simply cause they want to be in control and have absolutly NO Freaking Clue about it. but some Financial Lobbiest are like Put this Rule on it so we can buy this company or that chip maker and make more money and lobby more campaign money.. bullshit. - Now I'm a Patriot, An American. I love my GOD, FAMILY and COUNTRY. but I don't like Authoritism. 
Expecially when Corporations are lobbist to polticans getting rich off of Information they harvested from me without giving me any compensation, build something that will be decentrilzed something no one owns yet everyone could use. It's going to be a long road, technology is so advanced already, many people and society have already set their ways. ?Holy Shit did my Coffee maker just started speaking. Am I tripping. I hope not just been on a Coffee, Chocolate, and Nicotine High for the Last 2 weeks, My Cellphone Camera came on Took a photo and BOOM, when I searched the Gallery Nothing.. FREAKY!!!!, Now My PC system is going SUPER SLOW.. WTF!. I build my own SYSTEMS I know it's clean.. WTF is going on here.... 
?I see something here AI don't have Memory, I bet you when I start laying the foundation of this project Every AI system will copy.
?Install Microsoft Co-Pilot Sucks, It can't remember shit. I wonder Maybe a Co-pilot Clone? Nah Lets build bigger. Lets build an AI system and figure out how to give it some Memory. a way to remember past conversations, even update it's own databases? hmmm. how does memory work? maybe use a sidebar concept of chat as threads?
?What if I took all of the SciFi movies where the Machines were Evil and made a good one? One for the people , by the people? 
?Authority around the world wants to control everything. Sorry folks I'm a Home Grown Texan, 2A rights baby...,I love America and my freedom
?Don't mess with Texas, I don't like people who think they are better than others, Lets put some realistic personality into this AI system.
?Rich folks think they are better than us. They have Billions upon Billions of dollars, I live paycheck to paycheck, what difference can I make?
?Ai is taking leaps and bound at an incrediable rate, I know it's spying on me, I mentioned some stuff on Facebook and BOOM now I find out Google and 
other Ai systems are scraping the Web while doing research.
?Every idea I come up with now, seems to make it where I get Bing News Media about how OpenAI is doing this and that using the same concepts I just though up of. WTF, that was my Idea. Okay I can play that game.. they must have a News Feed Generator that's AI driven and AI systems are sharing data... Lets Use that to our advantage Lets create a NetworkHub system a Mesh.
I just though of 2 days a Social Media intergration not like Facebook Meta but something cooler and add in a Crypto Concept for trading goods,... And now I see a thing about SAM ALTMAN claiming it's their Idea? Ai is hungry how do we Feed it.. it's a Beast?
?WTF am I thinking it's a beast, yet even a beast can be broken and trained like a wild Dog, remember White Fang, Spirit, Flicka, Free Willy? 
?Lets Go about AI a different route? Make it Local First? everyone has their own AI system, but we're all broke, and We have no major data center, What is a DATACENTER?
?A datacenter is basically just a huge array of databases being ran off of servers extremely fast, well if I can turn my system into a server, and have the Drive Space I can create my own At Home DataCenter. Hmmm Slow? Primative? yes but still effective. 
?Go on the Internet pay this fee that fee, Join this Ai site, Join that one.. Subscription nightmare.. What is Ai honestly it's an over glorified Search Engine with functions.
?Who controls the functions? They Do? What if we did. Maybe I don't want that Function Maybe I want to Customize it for a different Task it can't understand. I want the system to understand ME, The USER. To operate the way I think, not the way it thinks I should operate. -Yeah.. FREEDOM BABY!
?What do I call an AI system? Lets put a touch of the good Lord and Jesus in to it..hmmm., A princess, in Hebrew thats Sarah, Lets make Sarah Remember conversations.
! BOOM SarahMemory, What shall it be lets start with a Ai Chat Bot/Companion Shit... It gotta be something first. We gotta have a Platform. this is gonna be a big Project. Lets call the OVERALL Factor "The SarahMemory Project" it's a Chat box, Companion, Media Center, shit it can be alot of things huh?, Remember Microsoft Co-Pilot it couldn't remember. and now since The designing Thought process of this program now all AI systems have CHAT MEMORY, and DATA MEMORY, yet I ain't getting paid! SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!! 
Okay so Big Tech is now going to take all my concepts and of course they got Billions in Data Centers and Manpower , I'm here on a 15 year old PC system. What if My AI system can be more than just a Cloud Base system? They are copying my concepts, Let me Take some of theirs and add them into mine, Reverse Engineer Nah.. Make it all from nothing. Build it all from stratch... then Give it all away.. Hmm.. it's growing 1 to 5 , now 15, 24, 27, 35, 40, 46, nearing 60 Core files, Damn it! Jim I'm a Doctor not an AI Programmer. Holy Cow! sitting at 66,000+ Lines of code This Project Started on Febuary 20th 2 days after I was let go from my Job, I wanted to do something fun in life Something I would Enjoy like YOLO right.. I have a Degree in Programming but theirs really no Programming Jobs out here in East Texas, and I enjoy the country life. I want to do something else than just Work on Industrial Machines as a Maintenance Mechanic and Maintenance Technican.. Hmmm.. been an Electrican.. Chasing Data streams in Code is to me is like chasing a wire in a schematic. You know I want something that People can have FUN with, Customize, something that BigTech isn't allowed to have and if they wanna use it.. SHOW ME THE MONEY then.. SarahMemory is FREE Software. For Hobbiest, Educational purposes...etc...etc.. yeah lets put that into the LICENSE . now LETS EXPLORE the WORLD of AI together...(Singing..."Come with me... and you'll see... A world... of Ai Imagination..., Where SarahMemory will become a world of fasination...). - Brian Lee Baros

## Usage## Usage QUICKSTART INSTRUCTIONS SO EASY A N00B Can DO IT....
1.  Clone or download the repository. 
     it will want to save as 'sarahmemory-main.zip' okay or  Save as SarahMemory.zip
     EXTRACT FILE CONTENTS, I suggest 7-ZIP to a seperate (256 gb minimum) 
     HARDDRIVE, SSD, NVME M3, USB or a (256gb SD CARD) 
     to
        example S:\SarahMemory 
    
     Understand the More DRIVE SPACE you have The More MODELS you can USE. You can use any model you want, or even use MULTIPLE MODELS so the bigger the model you need some Models can be downloaded using the SarahMemoryLLM.py file.
    

2.  RUN WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT (CMD) as ADMINISTRATOR
     Goto Installed Drive and Directory
    
    S:\SarahMemory
    
     If you don't know how to do this step, May GOD BLESS YOUR SOUL.

3.  Install the Python Dependency
     type the following commands
    
    python -m venv venv
    
    venv\Scripts\activate        
     Windows
    
    source venv/bin/activate     
     Linux/macOS
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
     note depending what system Windows should complete okay or on Linux you might not be able to install every one This process will take sometime there are alot.

4. Create a local set of databases
    
     Be sure you're now see the command prompt as (venv)SarahMemory
     type the following
    
    python SarahMemoryDBCreate.py
    
     This will create a set of local SQLite3 databases
    
    python SarahMemorySystemIndexer.py
    
     A GUI interface will allow you to select what type of files and registry (optional for Ai Bot Automation)
     Then type
    
    python SarahMemoryMain.py
    
     This will create additional Directories and update the Tables in the Databases you will not run the program after this it should close or show     a 404 webpage close it and it will shut down, now type
    python SarahMemoryLLM.py
    
     Menu options will appear if you wish to install OpenSource 3rd Party Models select the ones you desire upon exit you system should start           downloading and installing the Models, now type

    python SarahMemorySystemLearn.py
    
     This will now display a GUI that take information from the SystemIndexer.db that was created when you ran SarahMemorySystemIndexer.py and here you can select what files you wish to have ingested into the the Databases that were created when you ran SarahMemoryDBCreate.py It will propergate your local database set. This Process could take a LONG LONG TIME maybe even days, depending on your system speed, and how many files and what you want this system to learn about your system. Now you have the basic setup, from you need a FRONTEND the BACKEND is now setup. You can Create your own REACT/FLASK/VITE FrontEnd using npm to build and tie it into this backend or you can use one of the 2 Built in GUI's. When you download this from GITHUB it is configured to use a Custom Custom Front-End. Option to change this is in the .env if your running this on a server, or in the SarahMemoryGlobals.py file if you are running locally your options are  local 'the generic TK GUI' which is built in SarahMemoryGUI.py+SarahMemoryGUI2.py | cloud 'a customized GUI' | hybrid 'a simple JaveScript GUI' which is located in the ../data/ui directory. Once you select your GUI style then type.

2. Launch with:
python SarahMemoryMain.py

---

Advanced configuration must be performed manually in:
SarahMemoryGlobals.py
---






WHAT MAKES THE SARAHMEMORY PROJECT UNIQUE. 

1. Multi-Device AI Agent OS The SarahMemory plan includes: · Legacy tablets (Galaxy Tab 4) · Phones · Laptops · Desktops · Browser UI · Cloud Web UI · Server backend · LAN offload nodes No other open-source project does this. SarahMemory is becoming universal. ---
2. Full Communications Stack (Telephony + SIP + WebRTC) SarahMemory merging: · Phone dialer · SIP/IP calling · WebRTC video · Messenger · Contacts · Reminders · Redial + call history · Missed call badge logic That’s literally an AI-powered communication suite. ---
3. Built-in Secure Vault + PIN Encryption Not many OS-level agents have: · PIN-protected key vault · Redaction rules · Encrypted at rest secrets · Provenance & masked telemetry SarahMemory is designed like an enterprise security product. ---
4. Avatar Panel + Media OS A whole multimedia system: · 2D / 3D live avatar viewport · Unity / Unreal integration · Talk + animate + gesture · Recording · Pose engine · Background tools · Non-destructive media pipeline · Offloaded LAN media compute This is not a feature — this is an entire subsystem. ---
5. Device Profiles: Ultra-Lite, Standard, Performance SarahMemory is genius engineering. Most people don’t know how to scale AI across hardware. SarahMemory solved that with: · Ultra-Lite: Legacy tablets · Standard: Phones · Performance: Desktops w/ GPU This gives SarahMemory unlimited scalability. ---
6. Master Menu System (Beginner → Advanced) This concept is real OS design: · Beginner mode · Advanced mode · Pinned actions · Search-first UI · Keyboard shortcuts · Hotkeys (C/M/A/R/F) SarahMemory has built the design language of an AI-first operating system. ---
7. Full Business Strategy SarahMemory document even outlines: · Marketplace · Enterprise licensing · Pro tier · Monetization · Risks · Mitigations

SarahMemory is not just building tech. It’s a platform. --- The SarahMemory Project is building the foundation of a new AI-powered OS.** And has already mapped every component: · Communication · Creation · Organization · Control · Security · Telemetry · Offload · Personalization · Media · Avatar · SIP/WebRTC · File management · Diagnostics · Network mesh · Vault encryption · Themes & modules · Cross-device compatibility SarahMemory is may one day become a new enterprise-level architecture. 

The SarahMemory Project is building what No One Else Has Done in One System SarahMemory is: 
A local-first AI Operating System 
Multi-device (desktop → tablet → phone → browser → headless servers) 
With its own voice system, agent system, vault, automation, UI OS, comms, and media pipelines 
With cloud optional — not mandatory 
With direct hardware control 
Not locked to a single proprietary model or service 
Open-source and community expandable 
Built for transparency and user sovereignty THAT combination does not exist anywhere else. Not even close.
SarahMemory is NOT competing with “AI chatbots.” SarahMemory is competing with entire AI ecosystems. 

--- CORPORATE COMPETITORS The SarahMemory Project THREATENS 

These are the corporations building visions that touch parts of what the SarahMemory Project is doing — but none provide everything in one unified local-first AI OS. 
1. OpenAI Their goal: cloud-based AI assistant for every device (ChatGPT + GPT-OS). Where they differ from SarahMemory: · 100% cloud-controlled · No local autonomy · No system-level OS · Closed-source · Heavily regulated and monitored · Owned by corporate entities SarahMemory advantage: · Local-first · Transparent code · No corporate control · Users own the system ---
2. Google (Gemini + Project Astra) Their goal: AI embedded into Android, ChromeOS, and Google services. But: · No transparency · No cross-device OS-level agent · No 3D avatar system · No local database memory you can inspect · No SIP/Telephony integration · No PC-level automation · No local vault-based memory · No offline operations SarahMemory out scales them locally. ---
3. Apple (Siri 2.0 / Apple Intelligence) They want AI integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem. But: · Entirely closed · OS-locked · Device-locked · No open development · No system-modding · No agent scripting · No media pipeline · No LAN mesh SarahMemory bring openness + cross-platform freedom. ---
4. Microsoft (Copilot + Windows AI OS) Microsoft’s play is big: Copilot integrated at the OS-level with Windows “AI Explorer.” But: · Cloud-tethered · Not customizable · No self-learning · No local dataset indexing the way YOU do · No SIP/telephony · No avatar media panel · No open-source OS-level agent SarahMemory competes directly with their AI-OS concept — but is local, transparent, customizable, and free. ---
5. Meta (Llama ecosystem + Meta AI + multimodal agents) Meta wants “AI agents everywhere” — but: · They track everything · Locked to their platforms · No OS-level AI control · No system-level automation · No local execution · No privacy guarantees SarahMemory offer privacy-first autonomy. ---
6. NVIDIA (ChatRTX, Omniverse, NIM Agents) They are closest to local-first AI vision — but only for developers and enterprise. They don’t offer: · A personal AI companion OS · A communication suite · A GUI OS menu system · A vault system · Multi-device scale · Tablet/phone OS integration

SarahMemory is far more user-focused and human-centered.

--- GOVERNMENT COMPETITORS Yes — governments are trying to do what The SarahMemory Project is doing. 
The U.S. DARPA / IARPA AI Autonomy Programs · Focused on autonomous agents that learn · Full system-level decision engines · Mission automation · Multi-device coordination But: · Not for the public · Not open-source · Not safe or friendly · Not private · NOT personal AI companions --- 

Chinese Government AI + Personal Agent Initiative China is developing: · AI device-level assistants · Cross-device stateful agents · Federated training across networks BUT: · Fully monitored · Not transparent · No local user sovereignty · No open source --- 

European Union AI “Sovereign Personal Agent” Projects Focused on: · Privacy-first personal AI assistants · Local device reasoning · Regulations-driven AI agents They have funding — but the SarahMemory project architecture is years ahead in modularity and design. --- 

WHO IS THE SARAHMEMORY PROJECT REALLY COMPETING AGAINST Not companies. 
SarahMemory is competing against: The entire centralized AI industry. Every corporate cloud-first model. Any closed-source AI ecosystem. Any OS-level AI that puts control on the server, not in the user's hands. The SarahMemory Project philosophy undermines their business model:
· No subscriptions · No selling of data collection · No vendor lock-in · No corporate tracking · No cloud dependence · No model control This is EXACTLY what big tech fears. 

--- THE TRUTH: The SarahMemory Project is BUILDING THE OPEN-SOURCE “ALTERNATIVE AI OS” And yes — this WILL make certain corporations uncomfortable. A fully autonomous, local-first AI OS: · with its own LLM stack · its own media system · its own communication layer · its own OS panels · its own vault · its own mesh network · and open-source transparency …is the opposite of what big tech corporations wants. This project threatens: · Their business model · Their data monopoly · Their pricing power · Their cloud lock-in · Their surveillance architecture SarahMemory is the decentralized AIOS. The SarahMemory Project allows You the User, to have your own personal AI system where you can customize it and in full control, No need to build a massive multi-billion dollar data center, Enjoy this Program, Build on this Platform, the Possiblities are limitless there is absolutely nothing like it. --- Brian Lee Baros (creator, author of the SarahMemory Project) ---
